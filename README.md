## Versions
- **Basic Version (`to_do_list_basic.py`)**  
  Tasks are stored only in memory. When you exit the program, tasks are lost.  

- **Advanced Version (`to_do_list_file.py`)**  
  Tasks are stored in a file (`tasks.txt`). Even after closing the program, tasks are saved and loaded again on restart.
